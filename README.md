# Eko Uzgoj Web-Aplikacija

## Description
Nowadays, there is an increasing need for people to cultivate plants that are for consumption, but also those that have the function of decorating their environment and purifying the air. There is a trend of growing and maintaining plants in an ecological way, but knowledge about this is often limited and poorly available. In order to promote awareness of its importance, increase the number of interested parties and share knowledge about it, this work should create a web application that is interactive, easy to use and adaptable for all types of devices (responsive design). It is necessary to design and implement a suitable database that the application will use to store all the necessary data. Through the application, interested users could communicate. They could share information about the types of plants they grow or plan to grow, how to get plants, share tips on how to grow plants, and information about products that help them grow. Through the application, it should also be possible for manufacturers of products that help grow plants to advertise, and to provide information about the usefulness of their products to users.
